<p> Flashback to May of 2016. I had just finished my freshman year of college 
and I was heading into my sophomore year at the University of Pennsylvania. 
At this point, I wasn't completely sure what I wanted to do with my life. 
I was on the pre-medical track and thought of attending medical school after graduation, 
but it wasn't something I could really see myself doing. I was drawn more towards my interests
in the fine arts, especially English and creative writing. I would have loved to explore my 
interests in the fine arts a bit more while I was at school but I became so preoccupied with 
trying to do well in my pre-medical coursework that I didn't take advantage of the opportunity 
to pursue potentially more meaningful 
</p>

</div>

<p>But in the fall of 2016 leading up into my junior year I did try a few things </p>
<ul> 
    <li>I took a writing seminar on memory and cognition and an introduction to 17th C lit with a Milton class. </li>
    <li>I continued my premed coursework and finished up my Calculus sequence along with Biology.</li> 
    <li>I started taking intermediate Biology courses and worked on finishing my Chemistry requirement </li>
    <li>I took an interesting class on Modern Britain and read a range of British literature from 1700-2015</li> 
</ul> 
</p> 

<p>During my junior year, I started taking more courses in the English major but I didn't feel like the 
    ones I were taking were quite right for me. I took the following courses in the fall: 
<ol> 
    <li>Topics in Romanticism: Wordsworth and Coleridge </li> 
    <li>Topics Drama to 1660: Intro to Shakespeare</li>
    <li>Modern American Lit: Virginia Woolf</li> 
    <li>The World of Work </li>
</ol>
<p> The classes were too theory-based for me and I was not interested in the academic side of English literature. 
    It's good to know a bit of theory as a writer but the creative writing classes I'd take later would incorporate just the right amount of theory 
    into workshop time in a way that felt more natural for understanding the writing process. 
</p>
<p>Now, speaking of creative writing, here's what I took in the spring:</p>
<ol> 
    <li>Photographs and Stories: Writing from Photographs</li>
    <li> Documentary Writing </li>
    <li> Dante's Divine Comedy </li>
    <li> Elementary French I </li>
    <li> Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and Evolution </li> 
    <li> Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy and Evolution Lab (6to9pm!!!!)</li> 
    <li> Evolutionary Biology </li> 

<p>
This was a heavy semester when it came to labs and things like that and I regret taking classes 
that I didn't feel I truly enjoyed simply because I was afraid of career prospects. Instead of 
exploring things like tech and design, I kept pushing myself towards courses in Biology and the natural 
sciences because it just felt like that's what I was being pressured to do.
</p> 

<p> 
If I could go back in time, I would have built upon my creative writing experience throughout my senior year. 
During my senior year, I packed on more science classes and a few electives I needed to take. Post-graduation, I continued my 
education in the natural sciences and was about to apply to med school when the little voice inside of me started telling me to run...</p>

    so much within the span of a few years as well. If you want to check out my style
